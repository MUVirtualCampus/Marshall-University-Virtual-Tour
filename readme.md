Be sure to run: `npm install` followed by `jspm install` before beginning work

## Before Production: ##

* run the command `jspm bundle js/app-bootstrap build.js --minify` from the **public** directory
  
* run the command `gulp`

(NOTE: It may be advantageous to comment out the line `<script src="./build.js"></script>` inside **welcome.php** before development.
Just remember to uncomment it before production.)
